Cinema Booking App

In this project, we use fpdf, random, string and sqlite3 libraries and DB Browser for SQLite.

See how to download and install DB Browser for SQLite from https://linuxhint.com/install-sqlite-ubuntu-linux-mint/

After completing setup mentioned above, we create cinema.db and banking.db two empty files.

In this app, we book cinema ticket and transactions as per availability of ticket.

We also generate receipt in pdf format of ticket booking, if ticket was book successfully.
